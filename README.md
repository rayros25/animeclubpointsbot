Anime Club Point Bot (but BETTER!)

# Setup

install node & npm

npm install --only=prod in directory

run "generatedb.sh" (./generatedb.sh) to generate the database

run "run.sh" (./run.sh) to start the bot

run "run-daemon.sh" (./run-daemon.sh) to keep it running in background

# Heads Up

I don't really know anything about writing/running a Discord bot, but I'll do my best to figure all that stuff out.
